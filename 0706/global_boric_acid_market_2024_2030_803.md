<h1>Boric Acid Market Supply and Demand Analysis - Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030 (Production and Consumption Analysis)</h1><p>The global <strong>boric acid market</strong> is poised for steady growth, projected to expand from <strong>USD 1.31 billion in 2023 to USD 1.95 billion by 2030</strong>, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>5.8% during 2024-2030</strong>. This upward trajectory is fueled by robust demand across multiple industrial applications, though regional regulatory challenges and raw material availability present complex dynamics that industry players must navigate.</p><p><strong>1. Fiberglass Insulation Boom</strong><br>
The construction sector's increasing focus on energy efficiency has created a surge in demand for fiberglass insulation, where boric acid serves as a critical flame retardant. This application now accounts for over 40% of global boric acid consumption, with North America and Europe leading adoption due to stringent building codes.</p><p><strong>2. Borosilicate Glass Expansion</strong><br>
The exceptional thermal and chemical resistance of borosilicate glassâused in laboratory equipment, cookware, and pharmaceutical packagingâis driving increased boric acid consumption. The pharmaceutical glass packaging segment alone grew 8.4% annually in 2022, with Asia-Pacific emerging as the fastest-growing market.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
