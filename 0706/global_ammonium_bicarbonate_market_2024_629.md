<h1>Global Ammonium Bicarbonate Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>ammonium bicarbonate market</strong> is projected to decline from <strong>USD 1.23 billion in 2023 to USD 800 million by 2029</strong>, contracting at a <strong>negative CAGR of -6.90%</strong>, according to new market research. While facing regulatory headwinds in developed markets, the compound maintains stable demand in agriculture and packaged food sectors across emerging economies.</p><p>Ammonium bicarbonate (NHâHCOâ), a versatile inorganic salt, remains crucial as a nitrogen fertilizer and leavening agent despite market contraction. Its unique decomposition properties at baking temperatures make it indispensable for crisp-textured baked goods, while farmers value its rapid nitrogen release for short-cycle crops.</p><p><strong>1. Food Processing Expansion in Developing Nations:</strong><br>
The persistent demand for traditional leavening agents drives ammonium bicarbonate consumption, particularly in Asian food manufacturing. China's biscuit and cracker production grew by <strong>5.8% annually</strong> since 2020, maintaining demand for cost-effective chemical leaveners despite premium alternatives.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Smallholder farmers across South/Southeast Asia continue utilizing ammonium bicarbonate for its <strong>17-22% cheaper cost</strong> versus urea, particularly for vegetable and rice cultivation. India's fertilizer subsidy program allocated <strong>USD 27 billion in 2024</strong>, indirectly supporting commodity-grade ammonium bicarbonate consumption.</p><p><strong>3. Regulatory Phase-Outs in Western Markets:</strong><br>
The EU's Farm to Fork Strategy has accelerated replacement rates, with bakery formulations shifting to double-acting baking powders. This transition contributed to a <strong>38% decline</strong> in European ammonium bicarbonate food applications since 2018.</p><p>The market features <strong>22 major producers</strong>, primarily clustered in China's Shandong province which accounts for <strong>62% of global capacity</strong>. BASF and Sumitomo maintain Western production for specialty formulations, while cost-focused Asian players dominate commodity segments:</p><p>Recent capacity rationalization saw <strong>3 plant closures</strong> in Europe during 2023 as producers shifted focus toward value-added ammonium derivatives.</p><p>While the market contracts, producers should note:</p><p>The forthcoming <em>Global Ammonium Bicarbonate Market Report (2024-2029)</em> provides complete analysis of 28 national markets, 45 competitor profiles, and granular demand forecasts by segment.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
