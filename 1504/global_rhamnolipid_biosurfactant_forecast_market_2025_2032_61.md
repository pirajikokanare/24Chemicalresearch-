<h1>Rhamnolipid Biosurfactant Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Rhamnolipid biosurfactants are biological compounds primarily produced by bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Burkholderia. These glycolipid molecules are surfactants, meaning they reduce surface tension and exhibit unique properties such as emulsification, foaming, and detergency. Rhamnolipids are produced as a metabolic byproduct during the microbial growth process and can be found in nature, particularly in soil, water, and plants.</p><p>
These biosurfactants have gained attention for their sustainable, eco-friendly properties, especially in industrial applications, where synthetic surfactants are increasingly being replaced by bio-based alternatives due to their biodegradability and lower toxicity. Rhamnolipids are utilized across various industries, including agriculture, oilfield operations, household and personal care products, and industrial cleaning applications.</p><p>
