</p><p>This growth is driven by the increasing demand for refined hydrocarbon products in sectors such as automotive, packaging, and industrial manufacturing.Globally, growing demand for polymers, synthetic rubbers, and chemical intermediates is expected to drive expansion. Investments in cracking and downstream units, especially in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, are enhancing the availability and refinement of heavy C4 components.</p><p>
</p><p>Heavy Carbon 4 (Heavy C4), also referred to as heavy C4 fraction or heavy C4 component, plays a significant role in the petrochemical industry. It primarily pertains to the heavier components present in the C4 stream during butadiene extraction, especially within C4 cracking units. This component is characterized by the presence of isoprene, piperylene, butenes, butadiene, and other heavier hydrocarbons.</p><p>
</p><p>Heavy C4s are typically derived from steam crackers and catalytic crackers and are utilized as feedstock in the production of various value-added petrochemicals. These may include resins, synthetic rubber, adhesives, and intermediate chemicals. Their demand is influenced by the performance and expansion of industries such as automotive, construction, consumer goods, and packaging.</p><p>
</p><p>The utility of Heavy Carbon 4 lies in its ability to be further separated and refined to extract useful chemicals, making it an integral raw material in many downstream chemical applications. Due to growing industrial demand for efficient cracking processes and refined hydrocarbons, Heavy Carbon 4 has emerged as a critical segment in the global petrochemical value chain.</p><p>
