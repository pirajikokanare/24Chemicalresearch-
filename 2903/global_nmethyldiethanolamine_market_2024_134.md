<h1>N-Methyldiethanolamine Market, Global Outlook &amp; Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>N-Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) is an organic compound with the molecular formula CH3N(C2H4OH)2. It is a colorless, hygroscopic liquid with a mild ammonia-like odor. The compound is highly soluble in water, alcohol, and benzene. MDEA is primarily utilized for amine gas treating, a process also known as gas sweetening or acid gas removal. This involves the removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from natural gas and other industrial gas streams.</p><p>
</p><p>Given its efficiency in selectively removing H2S while minimizing CO2 removal, MDEA is preferred over conventional amines such as monoethanolamine (MEA) and diethanolamine (DEA). Other applications include its use in the textile, medical, and coatings industries.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
