The current copper-based lead frame materials can be mainly divided into Cu-Fe-P series, Cu-Ni-Si series and Cu-Cr-Zr series alloys according to the composition, among which Cu-Fe-P series occupies the main market. The nickel and silicon elements in the copper-nickel-silicon alloy can form a strengthening phase, so that the alloy will not reduce the electrical conductivity too much while having high strength and hardness. Since the research and development of copper-nickel-silicon alloy C7025 by the American Olin Company in the 1980s, countries have successively researched and developed copper-nickel-silicon alloys. At present, various brands of copper-nickel-silicon alloys have been listed.</p><p>
