<h1>Pyrophyllite Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Pyrophyllite is a rare phyllosilicate mineral that primarily occurs in specific metamorphic rock types. Known for its high alumina content and limited iron impurities (which need to be reduced to under 1%), Pyrophyllite has numerous industrial applications. This mineral belongs to the Pyrophyllite-Talc Group and is an aluminum analogue of ferrypyrophyllite. The key industrial uses of Pyrophyllite stem from its unique properties, including its use as a refractory material, in ceramics, cement, and fiberglass.</p><p>
