The polymer sector, valued at <strong>USD 650 billion globally</strong>, continues to drive AIBN consumption, with packaging and construction materials accounting for <strong>45% of total demand</strong>. As emerging economies accelerate infrastructure development, polymer production is expected to grow <strong>6-8% annually</strong> through 2030.</p><p><strong>2. Superior Technical Performance:</strong><br>
Compared to peroxide alternatives, AIBN offers <strong>30% greater temperature stability</strong> and reduced explosion risks during handling. These characteristics have led <strong>78% of specialty chemical manufacturers</strong> to prefer AIBN for sensitive polymerization processes.</p><p><strong>3. Growth in Emerging Economies:</strong><br>
Asia-Pacific now represents <strong>58% of global AIBN consumption</strong>, with China's chemical sector expanding at <strong>9% CAGR</strong>. India's polymer production surged <strong>22% in 2023 alone</strong>, creating substantial demand for high-quality polymerization initiators.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
