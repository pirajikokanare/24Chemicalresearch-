<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Pressure vessel steel refers to specialized steel grades used in the manufacturing of pressure vessels and similar equipment across industries such as petroleum, chemical, petrochemical, gas separation, and storage. These steels are designed to withstand high pressures and temperatures ranging from -20°C to 560°C, ensuring safety, durability, and performance under extreme conditions. The primary types of pressure vessel steels include carbon steel, carbon manganese steel, microalloy steel, low-alloy high-strength steel, and low-temperature use steel. These materials comply with international standards like ASME, ASTM, and EN to guarantee quality and reliability.</p><p>
