Low Pressure Plasma Spraying (LPPS) is a process used in materials science and engineering to deposit a variety of coatings onto a substrate. In LPPS, a plasma is created from a high-energy gas such as argon or helium, which is then used to melt and accelerate titanium powder towards a substrate. The powder is heated and accelerated to a high velocity, which allows it to bond to the substrate and form a coating.</p><p>
</p><p>
Titanium powder is a commonly used material in LPPS due to its high strength, low density, and excellent corrosion resistance. The resulting titanium coatings can be used in a variety of applications, including aerospace, biomedical implants, and automotive components.</p><p>
