</p><p><strong>Esbiothrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide primarily used as an ectoparasiticide. It is one of the eight stereoisomers of allethrin and is widely employed in the control of mosquitoes and other household insects. Known for its knockdown efficacy and fast action, Esbiothrin is commonly found in mosquito coils, vaporizers, mats, and sprays. It acts on the nervous system of insects, causing paralysis and death within seconds of exposure. Due to its broad-spectrum effectiveness and relatively low toxicity to humans and animals, it has become a staple in both residential and commercial pest control solutions.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Esbiothrin functions by modifying the sodium channels in the nerve cells of insects, causing repeated nerve impulses leading to paralysis. It is particularly favored in tropical and subtropical regions where vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, and Zika virus are prevalent. As urbanization and climate change contribute to the spread of such diseases, the demand for efficient vector control agents like Esbiothrin is anticipated to rise.</strong></p><p>
