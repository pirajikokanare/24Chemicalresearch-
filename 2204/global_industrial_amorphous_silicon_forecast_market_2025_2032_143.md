</p><p>In North America alone, the market size was estimated at USD 182.16 million in 2023, with an expected CAGR of 3.51% between 2025 and 2032. This region's market is propelled by robust demand in foundry work, electronics, and construction applications.</p><p>
</p><p>Industrial silicon, commonly referred to as metalloid silicon, is produced through the smelting of silica with carbonaceous reducing agents in submerged arc furnaces. This process yields silicon with a purity of approximately 98%, though high-purity grades reaching 99.99% are also available. The product is classified into different grades based on impurity content, specifically iron, aluminum, and calcium. By-products such as micro-silica fume, edge-skin silicon, black-skin silicon, and metallic silicon slag find applications in diverse end-use industries like concrete, refractories, and ceramics.</p><p>
