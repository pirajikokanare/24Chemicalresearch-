</p><p>Olivine is a group of rock-forming minerals primarily found in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks. Composed mainly of magnesium iron silicate (Mg2SiO4 to Fe2SiO4), olivine is easily identifiable by its green coloration and crystalline texture. These minerals typically crystallize in tandem with pyroxene and plagioclase, forming rocks like basalt and gabbro. Olivine is primarily mined for industrial purposes such as foundry sand, refractory materials, and metallurgical processes. It is commonly located in geologically active regions such as divergent tectonic plate boundaries and volcanic hotspots.</p><p>
