</p><p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>The all-vanadium redox flow battery is a type of rechargeable flow battery that employs vanadium ions in different oxidation states to store chemical potential energy. The vanadium redox battery exploits the ability of vanadium to exist in solution in four different oxidation states, and uses this property to make a battery that has just one electro active element instead of two. For several reasons, including their relatively bulky size, most vanadium batteries are currently used for grid energy storage, such as being attached to power plants or electrical grids. Unlike other RFBs, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) use only one element (vanadium) in both tanks, exploiting vanadium’s ability to exist in several states. By using one element in both tanks, VRBs can overcome cross-contamination degradation, a significant issue with other RFB chemistries that use more than one element. The energy density of VRBs depends on the concentration of vanadium: the higher the concentration, the higher the energy density.</p><p>
