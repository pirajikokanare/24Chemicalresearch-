<h1>Prepreg Carbon Fiber Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Prepreg carbon fiber refers to carbon fiber fabric that has been pre-impregnated with a resin system, typically epoxy, which already contains the appropriate curing agent. This enables the material to be directly placed into a mold without requiring additional resin. The curing process occurs under controlled heat and pressure, ensuring enhanced mechanical properties and uniformity. Prepreg carbon fiber is widely used in aerospace, automotive, energy, and electronics industries due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, superior durability, and thermal stability.</p><p>
