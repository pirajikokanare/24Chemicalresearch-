<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Polyester anti-static fabrics are textile materials designed to minimize or eliminate static electricity build-up. These fabrics are primarily made from polyester fibers that have undergone special treatments or engineering processes to enhance their conductivity and reduce static charge accumulation. They are widely utilized in industries where electrostatic discharge (ESD) poses a significant risk, such as electronics manufacturing, cleanrooms, pharmaceuticals, automotive, and workplaces handling flammable materials.</p><p>
</p><p>The demand for polyester anti-static fabrics has been growing due to the increasing need for electrostatic control in sensitive environments. These fabrics prevent damage to electronic components, reduce dust attraction, and enhance workplace safety, making them an essential material in multiple industrial applications.</p><p>
