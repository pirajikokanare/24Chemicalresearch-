Sodium zirconium silicate (Na2ZrSi3O9) is an important chemical product, which can be used as ramming materials in the melting part, clarification part and kiln wall of glass furnaces, as well as tanning agents in the field of tanning and as optical glass chemical raw materials. In the prior art, zircon powder (zirconium silicate), sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide are used as raw materials to prepare sodium zirconate silicon (Na2ZrSiO3). Because there are many impurities in the zircon powder, if sodium zirconium silicate (Na2ZrSi3O9) is prepared by this method, the whiteness and purity of the sodium zirconium silicate (Na2ZrSi3O9) product will be seriously affected. If this sodium zirconium silicate product is used as a raw material for optical glass, impurities such as TiO2 and Fe2O3 will cause serious coloring of the glass and increase light absorption. Therefore, it is extremely important to prepare high-purity sodium zirconium silicate (Na2ZrSi3O9).</p><p>
