The global key manufacturers of Titanium Dioxide Coated Micas include BASF, CQV, Eckart, Kolortek, Sun Chemical, Zhejiang Ruicheng Effect Pigment, Zhejiang Coloray Technology Development, Shantou Longhua Pearl Lustre Pigments and Hali Industrial, etc. in 2023, the global top five players have a share approximately % in terms of revenue.</p><p>
Nano-scale titanium dioxide (T20Q) and aluminum powder mixed pigments or mica pearlescent pigments coated with nano-titanium dioxide are added to the coating, and the coating can produce mysterious and changing color-dependent effects, mainly because when incident light hits For titanium dioxide particles, due to the small particle size, the blue light will be strongly scattered. As a result, the green light and red light (yellow phase) that remove the blue light are reflected by the aluminum sheet and become regular reflection light, that is, the scattered light has a strong blue phase. Light, the reflected light is light with a strong yellow phase (gold), and different hues can be seen with different viewing angles.</p><p>
