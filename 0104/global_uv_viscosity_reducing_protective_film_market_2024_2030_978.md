</p><p>UV viscosity reducing protective film is a special film material, which is mainly used to protect the surface coating or printed pattern from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, preventing sticking and damage. UV viscosity reducing protective film is usually made of polyester film or polycarbonate film, and the surface is coated with a special adhesive. When the film is exposed to ultraviolet light, the adhesive will undergo a chemical reaction to reduce its stickiness, thereby achieving the adhesion degradation between the protective film and the object to be protected. The main functions of UV viscosity-reducing protective film are as follows: 1. Protect the surface: UV-viscosity-reducing protective film can effectively protect surface coatings, printed patterns, labels, etc. from damage and fading by ultraviolet rays. It can block ultraviolet radiation, reduce photooxidative reaction, and prolong the life of the protected object.2. Reduce viscosity: After the UV viscosity-reducing protective film is irradiated by ultraviolet rays, the viscosity of the adhesive will decrease, which will weaken the adhesion between the protective film and the object to be protected. In this way, when the protective film needs to be removed, the protective film can be peeled off more easily without causing damage to the object to be protected. 3. Transparency: UV viscosity reducing protective film has good transparency and will not affect the appearance and visual effect of the protected object. It can maintain the clarity and brightness of the protected object. UV viscosity reducing protective film is widely used in various products and fields that need protection, such as electronic products, mobile phone screens, automotive glass, advertising signs, interior decoration, etc. It can effectively protect the appearance and quality of the product, prolong the service life, and improve the value and competitiveness of the product.</p><p>
