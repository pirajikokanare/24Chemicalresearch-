<strong>Market Size Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Potassium glutamate is a potassium salt of glutamic acid, primarily used in medical and pharmaceutical applications. It is widely utilized for treating hepatic encephalopathy caused by elevated ammonia levels, severe hepatic insufficiency, and in combination with anti-epileptic drugs for petit mal seizures and psychomotor seizures. Additionally, potassium glutamate is particularly beneficial for patients suffering from hypokalemia. The compound is often combined with glutamate for enhanced clinical efficacy. Beyond medical use, potassium glutamate also finds applications in food additives and dietary supplements.</p><p>
