Vein Graphite is considered a naturally occurring form of pyrolytic (deposited from a liquid phase) graphite. Veined graphite gets its name from the fact that it occurs in the veins and fissures of closed "ore" rocks. This graphite is formed by the direct deposition of solid graphitic carbon from subterranean high-temperature fluids called pegmatite fluids.</p><p>
