Photovoltaic glass is the main auxiliary material of photovoltaic modules, providing high light transmittance and protection performance in the module. At present, ultra-clear rolled glass is the mainstream production process. The core competitiveness of the industry comes from cost control: the ultra-white quartz sand at the raw material end is hard to find, and the resource attributes are strong. The self-owned placer has an obvious effect in reducing procurement costs. Leading photovoltaic glass companies have deployed ultra-white placer in advance; the cost side tests soda ash, fuel control.</p><p>
