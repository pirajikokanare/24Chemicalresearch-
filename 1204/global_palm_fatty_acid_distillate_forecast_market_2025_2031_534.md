Growth in key industries like biofuels, oleochemicals, and animal nutrition continues to offer pockets of opportunity. However, market valuation is influenced by fluctuating palm oil production volumes, regulatory policies regarding biofuel usage, and environmental concerns over palm plantation practices.</p><p>
</p><p>Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) is a byproduct generated during the physical refining of crude palm oil. At ambient temperature, it appears as a light brown semi-solid, transforming into a brown liquid upon heating. PFAD primarily consists of free fatty acids (FFAs), typically comprising 70–80% of its content. The two main FFAs present are palmitic acid and oleic acid. The remaining 20% of PFAD includes triglycerides, partial glycerides, and minor yet valuable compounds such as vitamin E, sterols, and squalene.</p><p>
</p><p>PFAD holds strategic importance in various industries due to its versatility and cost-effectiveness. It is a preferred raw material in sectors such as the oleochemical industry, soap manufacturing (especially laundry soap), animal feed production, and increasingly, bio-diesel manufacturing. Its wide range of applications and relatively low price make PFAD a high-demand commodity in both developed and emerging markets.</p><p>
