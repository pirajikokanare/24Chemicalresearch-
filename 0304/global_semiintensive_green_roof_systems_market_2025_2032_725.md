<h1>Semi-intensive Green Roof Systems Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p><strong style="font-size:13px">Semi-intensive green roof systems</strong> combine the lightweight and low-maintenance characteristics of extensive roofs with the versatility and aesthetic appeal of intensive roofs. They feature a richer and deeper substrate (usually 12-20 cm) compared to extensive green roofs, allowing the growth of diverse plant species, including small shrubs, grasses, and forbs.</p><p>
</p><p>These systems are primarily designed for highly visible areas, improving urban aesthetics while offering ecological benefits such as stormwater management, enhanced insulation, and biodiversity support. Unlike extensive green roofs, semi-intensive systems require moderate maintenance due to the diversity of vegetation and substrate depth.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
