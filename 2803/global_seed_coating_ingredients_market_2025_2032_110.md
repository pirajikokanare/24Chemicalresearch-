</p><p><strong>Seed coating ingredients</strong> are substances or formulations applied to seeds to enhance their performance, protection, and handling during planting and germination. These coatings create a thin layer on the seed surface, offering benefits such as improved seed germination, disease resistance, and better nutrient absorption. Seed coating formulations typically contain binders, colorants, active ingredients (such as pesticides, fungicides, or biologicals), and additives to support growth.</p><p>
</p><p>The primary purpose of seed coating is to facilitate precision planting, reduce seed loss, and ensure uniform distribution in the soil. Various industries, including agriculture, horticulture, and forestry, widely utilize seed coating technologies to improve crop yields and productivity.</p><p>
