Common Polyether diols are polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and poly (tetramethylene ether) glycol. The examples shown below are fairly low molecular weight trials based on glycerin (a triol) being reacted with propylene oxide, ethylene oxide or a combination of the two. In reality, the chains would not be of equal length in any one molecule and there would be a distribution of molecular weight polyols within the material. Polyether polyols account for about 90% of the polymeric polyols used industrially, the balance consists of polyester polyols.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify">Polyether polyols' major use is in polyurethane foams. Flexible foams are primarily used in cushioning applications such as furniture, bedding and car seats, and in carpet underlay. Rigid foam's largest consumer is the construction industry where it is mostly used for insulation. Rigid foam is also used in commercial refrigeration and packaging. Smaller uses for Polyether polyols include elastomers, adhesives and sealants, surface coatings and polyurethane fibers.</p><p>
