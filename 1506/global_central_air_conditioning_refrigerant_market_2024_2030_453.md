<h1>Global Central Air Conditioning Refrigerant Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>central air conditioning refrigerant market</strong> is projected to expand from <strong>USD 18.7 billion in 2024 to USD 28.3 billion by 2030</strong>, growing at a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.1% during the forecast period</strong>, according to latest industry analysis. This growth trajectory is driven by rising demand for energy-efficient cooling solutions and stringent environmental regulations phasing out ozone-depleting refrigerants.</p><p><strong>1. Regulatory Shifts Driving Product Innovation:</strong><br>
The implementation of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol has accelerated the transition toward low-GWP refrigerants across 125+ signatory countries. In 2023 alone, <strong>49% of new commercial HVAC installations</strong> in North America and Europe adopted R32 and R290 refrigerants, marking a significant shift from traditional R22 systems.</p><p><strong>2. Climate-Specific Demand Patterns:</strong><br>
Tropical regions including Southeast Asia and the Middle East are exhibiting <strong>8.7% annual growth</strong> in refrigerant demand, driven by increasing urbanization and rising disposable incomes. Meanwhile, China's carbon neutrality goals have spurred <strong>R&amp;D investments exceeding USD 2.4 billion</strong> in next-gen refrigerant technologies since 2021.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
