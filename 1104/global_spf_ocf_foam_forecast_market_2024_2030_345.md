<strong>Market Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF) and One-Component Foam (OCF) are two types of foam materials widely used in various industries, including construction, automotive, and packaging. SPF is a spray-applied plastic that forms a continuous insulation and air sealing barrier on walls, roofs, and other surfaces. It is known for its high thermal resistance and efficiency in reducing energy costs. OCF, on the other hand, is a moisture-cured polyurethane prepolymer that expands and hardens when exposed to moisture in the air. OCF is commonly used for filling, sealing, and insulating gaps and cracks in buildings.</p><p>
</p><p>Both SPF and OCF play vital roles in improving energy efficiency, enhancing structural integrity, and providing thermal insulation. Their versatility, ease of application, and long-lasting performance have led to their increasing demand in various industries worldwide.</p><p>
