<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
Powder coating is a solid, powdery synthetic resin coating composed of solid resin, pigment, filler, and auxiliary substances. Unlike conventional solvent-based or water-based coatings, powder coatings do not use a liquid medium for dispersion. Instead, air serves as the dispersion medium. This unique property eliminates solvent pollution, enables 100% film formation, and results in lower energy consumption.</p><p>
</p><p>Powder coatings are widely used across industries such as automotive, appliances, furniture, and construction due to their superior durability, resistance to corrosion, and environmental friendliness. These coatings can be thermoplastic or thermoset, with the latter offering higher chemical and heat resistance.</p><p>
