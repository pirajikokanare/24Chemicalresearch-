<h1>Middle East Pea Fibre Market Research Report 2024-2030</h1><p><strong>The Middle East Pea Fibre market is projected to grow from US$ 28.5 million in 2024 to US$ 39.7 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period</strong>, according to comprehensive new market research. This growth reflects the region's increasing demand for <strong>plant-based, functional food ingredients</strong> across multiple industries, from bakery to nutritional supplements.</p><p>Pea fibreâa nutrition-dense byproduct of pea processingâhas gained significant traction as both a <strong>texturizing agent and dietary supplement</strong>, offering <strong>high fiber content (up to 85% insoluble fiber), gluten-free properties, and clean-label appeal</strong>. These characteristics make it invaluable for <strong>health-conscious consumers, food manufacturers reformulating products, and pharmaceutical applications</strong> targeting digestive health.</p><p><strong>1. Surging Demand for Plant-Based Ingredients:</strong><br>
The Middle East's plant-based food sector is booming, growing at an estimated <strong>11% CAGR</strong>, with pea fibre emerging as a preferred binder and texturizer in meat alternatives. UAE and Saudi Arabia now account for <strong>62% of regional plant-protein launches</strong> incorporating pea derivatives, as manufacturers seek non-GMO, allergen-free solutions.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

With <strong>73% of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) residents</strong> consuming below recommended fiber levels, functional foods fortified with pea fibre see strong demand. The ingredientâs <strong>prebiotic propertiesâshown in clinical studies to increase beneficial gut bacteria by 25-35%</strong>âalign perfectly with regional wellness trends.</p><p><strong>3. Expansion of Local Processing Capabilities:</strong><br>
While traditionally import-dependent, Middle Eastern countries are investing in pea processing infrastructure. The UAEâs <strong>2023 commissioning of a dedicated pea protein facility</strong> signals a strategic shift toward localized supply chains, reducing lead times by up to 40% for regional manufacturers.</p><p>Despite robust demand, the market faces notable constraints:</p><p><strong>Price Volatility:</strong> Global pea shortages in 2023 caused <strong>22-28% price fluctuations</strong>, forcing Middle Eastern food brands to reformulate products with alternative fibers quarterly to manage costs.</p><p><strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> Pea fibreâs <strong>grittiness and water absorption characteristics</strong> (it absorbs 3-5 times its weight) challenge formulators, requiring additional R&amp;Dâ5-7% of product development budgetsâto optimize mouthfeel.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Fragmentation:</strong> Gulf countriesâ evolving food additive regulations create compliance headaches, with <strong>60-day average delays</strong> for new product approvals as standards harmonize across the GCC.</p><p><strong>1. Medical Nutrition Sector Expansion:</strong><br>
The <strong>US$ 1.2 billion Middle East clinical nutrition market</strong> presents untapped potential, with pea fibre being clinically validated to enhance mineral absorption by <strong>15-20% in patients with malabsorption disorders</strong>âa critical benefit for regional populations with high diabetes prevalence.</p><p><strong>2. Sustainable Packaging Solutions:</strong><br>
Innovators are exploring pea fibreâs use in <strong>biodegradable food packaging</strong>, capitalizing on its film-forming properties. UAE-based startups secured <strong>US$ 7.8 million in funding</strong> in 2023 for such applications, responding to Dubaiâs single-use plastics ban.</p><p><strong>3. Halal-Certified Functional Foods:</strong><br>
With <strong>92% of Middle East consumers</strong> insisting on Halal certification, pea fibreâs natural compatibility with Islamic dietary laws positions it ideally for fortified foods targeting Ramadan and year-round consumption.</p><p><strong>Blended Fiber Solutions:</strong><br>
    Combining pea with citrus or oat fibers (<strong>48% of new Middle East fiber launches in 2023</strong>) improves technical performance while meeting clean-label demands.</p><p><strong>Flavor Masking Innovations:</strong><br>
    Advanced extrusion techniques now reduce peaâs beany off-notes by <strong>70-80%</strong>, enabling broader use in premium applications like protein bars and shakes.</p><p><strong>E-Commerce Distribution Growth:</strong><br>
    Online sales of fiber supplements grew <strong>35% year-over-year</strong> in GCC markets, with pea fibre products benefiting from direct-to-consumer models emphasizing digestive health claims.</p><p>The market features a mix of <strong>global specialists and regional importers</strong>, with <strong>Roquette FrÃ¨res, Cosucra, and Emsland Group</strong> leading through technical expertise and sustainable sourcing. Local distributors like UAEâs <strong>Green Gold Farms</strong> are gaining ground by offering <strong>just-in-time delivery and customized blends</strong> tailored to Middle Eastern formulations.</p><p><strong>By Type:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><strong>By Country:</strong></p><p>This press release highlights findings from the <em>Middle East Pea Fibre Market Research Report 2024-2030</em>, providing complete analysis of market size, segmentation, competitive strategies, and emerging opportunities shaping the industryâs evolution across the region.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
