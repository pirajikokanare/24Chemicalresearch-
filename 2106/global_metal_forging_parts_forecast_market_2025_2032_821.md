<h1>Metal Forging Parts Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>metal forging parts market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 67,150 million in 2023 to USD 109,653.19 million by 2032</strong>, at a <strong>CAGR of 5.60% during 2025-2032</strong>, according to a comprehensive market analysis. This steady expansion reflects the indispensable role of forged components across critical industries including automotive, aerospace, and energy infrastructure.</p><p>Metal forgingâa manufacturing process that shapes metal through compressive forcesâdelivers superior mechanical properties compared to cast or machined alternatives. The technology produces components with <strong>enhanced structural integrity, fatigue resistance, and directional strength</strong>, making it the preferred choice for safety-critical applications from turbine shafts to automotive drivetrains.</p><p><strong>1. Automotive Industry's Lightweighting Imperative:</strong><br>
As automakers strive to meet stringent emission regulations, forged aluminum and magnesium components are gaining prominence. The average vehicle now contains <strong>12-15% forged parts by weight</strong>, with electric vehicles demanding specialized forged battery housings and motor components capable of withstanding higher torque loads.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

With commercial aircraft deliveries projected to reach <strong>1,200-1,500 units annually by 2025</strong>, demand for high-performance forged turbine disks, landing gear, and structural components is accelerating. Forgings account for approximately <strong>25% of an aircraft's structural weight</strong>, valued for their ability to maintain integrity under extreme conditions.</p><p><strong>3. Energy Infrastructure Investments:</strong><br>
Global investments in conventional and renewable energy infrastructure are driving demand for large forged components. The wind energy sector alone requires <strong>30-50 tons of forged steel per megawatt</strong> for turbine shafts and gearbox components, with the offshore wind market growing at <strong>14% CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p><p>Despite robust demand, the industry faces several constraints:</p><p><strong>1. Advanced Alloy Development:</strong><br>
Next-generation nickel-based superalloys and titanium aluminides are enabling <strong>15-20% weight reduction</strong> in aerospace components while maintaining high-temperature performance. These materials are driving premium pricing with <strong>30-45% higher margins</strong> compared to conventional steel forgings.</p><p><strong>2. Digital Forge Technologies:</strong><br>
Implementation of AI-driven process simulation and IoT-enabled forging presses is reducing material waste by <strong>18-25%</strong> while improving dimensional accuracy. Major players are investing <strong>6-8% of annual revenues</strong> in Industry 4.0 upgrades to maintain competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>3. Near-Net-Shape Forging:</strong><br>
Advanced precision forging techniques are minimizing machining requirements, with some components achieving <strong>95% material utilization rates</strong>. This approach is particularly valuable for expensive aerospace alloys where raw material costs can exceed <strong>60% of component value</strong>.</p><p>The market remains concentrated among established metallurgical giants, with <strong>Precision Castparts Corp (Berkshire Hathaway), Howmet Aerospace, and Thyssenkrupp</strong> collectively holding <strong>35-40% market share</strong> in premium forgings. These leaders are distinguished by their:</p><p>Emerging competitors from Asia, particularly <strong>Bharat Forge and AVIC Heavy Machinery</strong>, are gaining ground through:</p><p>This press release is based on the market research report <em>Metal Forging Parts Market: Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</em>. The study provides in-depth analysis of market size, share, competitive dynamics, and emerging opportunities across all key segments and regions.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
