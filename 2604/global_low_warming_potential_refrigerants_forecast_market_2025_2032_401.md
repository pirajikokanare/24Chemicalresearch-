<h1>Low Warming Potential (GWP) Refrigerants Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The Low Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants market refers to a segment of the HVAC&amp;R (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration) industry that utilizes refrigerants with lower GWP values. These refrigerants are used in a variety of cooling systems to minimize their environmental impact by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Low-GWP refrigerants are essential in mitigating the effects of climate change as they contribute less to global warming compared to traditional refrigerants.</p><p>
</p><p>High GWP refrigerants, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), have been a significant cause of ozone depletion and global warming. As a result, there has been a global push to phase them out in favor of refrigerants that are both energy-efficient and less harmful to the environment. In this context, refrigerants with low GWP values, including carbon dioxide, ammonia, propane, and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), have emerged as critical alternatives.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
