<h1>Global Medical-grade Cobalt-60 Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>medical-grade cobalt-60 market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 120 million in 2024 to USD 180 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.8%</strong> during the forecast period, according to latest industry analysis. This growth trajectory reflects the expanding applications of cobalt-60 in radiation therapy and medical device sterilization, coupled with increasing global cancer incidence rates.</p><p>Cobalt-60 - a radioisotope renowned for its gamma radiation capabilities - has become indispensable in modern medicine. Its <strong>precise dosage control</strong> and <strong>reliable emission characteristics</strong> make it vital for <strong>cancer treatment, blood irradiation, and sterilization of single-use medical devices</strong>.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Cancer Burden:</strong><br>
Global cancer cases are expected to increase by <strong>47% from 2020 to 2040</strong>, driving unprecedented demand for radiotherapy solutions. Cobalt-60 teletherapy units remain crucial in developing nations where they constitute <strong>over 60% of radiation therapy installations</strong> due to their cost-effectiveness and reliability.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

The global medical device market, projected to reach <strong>USD 612 billion by 2026</strong>, requires dependable sterilization methods. Gamma irradiation using cobalt-60 currently processes <strong>40-50% of all single-use medical devices</strong>, favored for its material penetration capabilities and batch processing efficiency.</p><p><strong>3. Emerging Market Expansion:</strong><br>
While <strong>North America</strong> dominates current consumption, the <strong>Asia-Pacific region is growing at an 8.2% CAGR</strong> - the fastest globally. Countries like India and China are investing heavily in radiotherapy infrastructure, with <strong>182 new cobalt therapy units</strong> installed across Asia in 2023 alone.</p><p>Despite strong fundamentals, the industry faces notable obstacles:</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Complexities:</strong> Producing cobalt-60 requires specialized nuclear reactors, with just <strong>seven commercial production sites worldwide</strong>. This concentrated supply creates vulnerabilities, as seen when pandemic-related disruptions caused <strong>30-45 day delivery delays</strong> in 2022.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Hurdles:</strong> Transportation and handling of radioactive materials require compliance with stringent IAEA and national regulations, increasing operational costs by <strong>18-25%</strong> compared to conventional medical isotopes.</p><p><strong>Competition from Alternatives:</strong> Linear accelerators (LINACs) are capturing <strong>12% of new cancer therapy installations</strong> annually in developed markets, though their higher costs maintain cobalt-60's relevance in budget-conscious regions.</p><p><strong>1. Next-Generation Radiotherapy:</strong><br>
Advancements in <strong>gamma knife radiosurgery</strong> and <strong>high-precision collimation systems</strong> are expanding cobalt-60's therapeutic applications. The global radiosurgery market is forecast to grow at <strong>7.1% annually through 2030</strong>, creating new demand streams.</p><p><strong>2. Blood Irradiation Growth:</strong><br>
With transplant procedures increasing by <strong>6.3% yearly</strong>, blood irradiation to prevent transfusion-associated complications represents an underpenetrated market. Modern compact irradiators using cobalt-59 are gaining traction in blood banks worldwide.</p><p><strong>3. Emerging Sterilization Applications:</strong><br>
The pharmaceutical industry is adopting gamma sterilization for <strong>biologics and temperature-sensitive drugs</strong>, with 32 new drug approvals in 2023 specifying irradiation in their sterilization protocols.</p><p><strong>Technology Modernization:</strong><br>
	New cobalt-60 source designs now offer <strong>40% longer usable lifespans</strong> and <strong>15% higher dose uniformity</strong>, reducing operational costs for healthcare providers.</p><p><strong>Regional Capacity Expansion:</strong><br>
	Countries like India and Argentina are developing domestic cobalt-60 production capabilities to reduce import dependence, with India's BARC commissioning a <strong>new 750 TBq/year facility</strong> in 2024.</p><p><strong>Hybrid Treatment Approaches:</strong><br>
	Leading oncology centers are combining cobalt-60 therapy with <strong>immunotherapy and targeted drugs</strong>, achieving synergistic effects that improve patient outcomes.</p><p>The market features a <strong>tightly consolidated structure</strong>, with <strong>Bruce Power, Rosatom, and CNNC</strong> controlling <strong>78% of global production capacity</strong>. These players are vertically integrated from isotope production to medical applications.</p><p>Specialty providers like <strong>Eckert &amp; Ziegler</strong> focus on value-added applications, developing innovative source geometries and delivery systems for precision medicine applications. Their R&amp;D investments grew <strong>22% year-over-year</strong> in 2023.</p><p><strong>By Type:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p>This press release is based on the comprehensive market research report "Global Medical-grade Cobalt-60 Market Research Report 2024 (Status and Outlook)".
