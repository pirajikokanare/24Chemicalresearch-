<h1>POM Resins Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>POM resins market</strong> is projected to expand from <strong>USD 2.6 billion in 2023 to USD 3.7 billion by 2030</strong>, growing at a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.0% during 2024-2030</strong>, according to new market analysis. This growth trajectory reflects the material's critical role in replacing metals across automotive, electronics, and industrial applications due to its superior mechanical properties and cost efficiency.</p><p>Polyoxymethylene (POM) resins - commonly called acetal resins - have become indispensable engineering thermoplastics thanks to their <strong>exceptional wear resistance, dimensional stability, and chemical resistance</strong>. These characteristics make them ideally suited for <strong>precision components, friction-bearing parts, and demanding industrial applications</strong> where metal alternatives prove too heavy or costly.</p><p><strong>1. Automotive Lightweighting Trends:</strong><br>
With automakers aggressively pursuing weight reduction to meet emissions standards, POM resins are increasingly replacing metals in <strong>fuel systems, door handles, seatbelt components, and interior trim</strong>. The automotive sector now accounts for <strong>35% of global POM resin consumption</strong>, with electric vehicle adoption creating new application opportunities in battery components and charging systems.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
