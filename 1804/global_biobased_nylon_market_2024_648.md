</p><p>Bio-based nylons are similar in properties to conventional nylon, except they are produced using specialty bio-based monomers, rather than the conventional petroleum-derived monomers. They are gaining interest in the industry because they offer potential cost savings, and production of the monomers allows reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Bio-based nylon resins are expected to be drop-in replacements for conventional nylons used in manufacturing an array of consumer goods, in medical applications, etc. The success of bio-based nylons versus conventionally produced nylons depends on the price competiveness, economics of the raw materials, and production processes.</p><p>
