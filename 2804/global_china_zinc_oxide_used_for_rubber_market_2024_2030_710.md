Zinc Oxide for Rubber is a key additive used in rubber compounding, acting as an activator in the vulcanization process and improving various properties of rubber products, including heat dissipation and UV resistance.</p><p>
China's Zinc Oxide for Rubber market is growing steadily, driven by the country's large tire manufacturing industry and expanding automotive sector. In 2023, China consumed approximately 720,000 metric tons of zinc oxide for rubber applications, with 90% used domestically and 10% exported in rubber products. The tire industry remains the largest consumer, accounting for 70% of demand, followed by industrial rubber goods at 20% and footwear at 10%. The market benefited from China's position as the world's largest automobile market, leading to a 8% increase in tire production in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on developing high-dispersibility zinc oxide grades, with new products offering 25% better dispersion and 15% lower dosage requirements compared to 2020 standard grades. The market is seeing growth in nano-zinc oxide for high-performance rubber applications, increasing at 10% annually, driven by demands in the aerospace and high-speed rail sectors. In 2023, new environmental regulations on tire labeling led to a 20% increase in the use of zinc oxide in low-rolling-resistance tire compounds. The industry faces challenges from raw material price volatility, but vertical integration strategies are helping major players stabilize costs. Emerging applications in self-healing rubber are showing promise, with specialized zinc oxide grades for smart materials growing at 15% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China's push towards electric vehicles, with zinc oxide for EV-specific tire compounds projected to grow at 7% CAGR through 2030.</p><p>
