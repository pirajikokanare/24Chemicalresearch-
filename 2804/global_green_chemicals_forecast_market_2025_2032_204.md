<h1>Green Chemicals Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Green chemicals, also known as bio-based chemicals, are sustainable chemicals derived from renewable bio-based feedstocks. Unlike conventional chemicals produced from petroleum-based resources, green chemicals emphasize minimal environmental impact, utilizing natural and renewable raw materials such as biomass, agricultural residues, and plant-based resources. Their production processes are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve energy, and maintain ecological balance. This eco-friendly approach not only promotes environmental sustainability but also aligns with global efforts to reduce carbon footprints and promote a circular economy.</p><p>
