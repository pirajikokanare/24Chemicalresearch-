</p><p><strong>Cold Mixed Asphalt Additives refer to specialized chemical compounds used in the production of cold asphalt mixes, which are typically employed for road maintenance and patching at ambient temperatures. Unlike traditional hot mix asphalt, cold mixes do not require high-temperature processing, making them particularly suitable for low-temperature applications (0–30 °C). These additives create an anti-sticking film around the bitumen-coated aggregate, enhancing workability, durability, and overall performance of the asphalt mixture. The product is typically composed of a blend of various polymers, is liquid at room temperature, slightly odorous, with a flash point around 290 °C and a freezing point of -5 °C, indicating a stable and manageable chemical nature.</strong></p><p>
