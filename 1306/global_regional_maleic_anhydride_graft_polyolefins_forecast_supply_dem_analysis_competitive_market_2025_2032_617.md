<h1>Maleic Anhydride Graft Polyolefins Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032: Supply and Demand analysis, Regional Analysis and Competitive Analysis</h1><p>The global <strong>maleic anhydride graft polyolefins (MAH-g-PO) market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 1.05 billion in 2023 to USD 1.61 billion by 2032</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 4.9% during 2025-2032</strong>, according to latest industry analysis. This growth trajectory underscores mounting demand for high-performance polymer modification agents across automotive, packaging, and construction sectors.</p><p>Maleic anhydride grafted polyolefinsâa functionally enhanced polymer modification technologyâdeliver <strong>superior adhesion to polar substrates like nylon, EVOH, and metal</strong> while maintaining polyolefin processing advantages. Their unique compatibility profile makes them indispensable for <strong>multi-material bonding, impact modification, and interfacial coupling</strong> in engineered plastics applications.</p><p><strong>1. Lightweighting Imperative in Automotive Sector:</strong><br>
Automotive OEMs require <strong>35% weight reduction targets by 2030</strong>, driving adoption of MAH-grafted polyolefins in hybrid material bonding. These modifiers enable aluminum-plastic composite designs that reduce component weights by <strong>18-22%</strong> while meeting crash safety standards. Major automakers deployed these solutions in <strong>27 new EV platforms in 2023 alone</strong>.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
