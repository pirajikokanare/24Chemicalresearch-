</p><p>Ferric Sulphate, also known as iron(III) sulfate or Fe2(SO4)3, is an inorganic compound widely used in water treatment, wastewater treatment, and various industrial applications. It is a yellowish-brown solid that readily dissolves in water to form acidic solutions.</p><p>
</p><p>Ferric Sulphate (Feâ(SOâ)â) is a chemical compound primarily used as a coagulant in water treatment processes. It is highly effective in removing suspended solids, turbidity, and organic matter from water, making it an essential substance for purifying drinking water and treating industrial wastewater. Ferric sulphate is also used in various applications such as in the production of pigments, pharmaceuticals, and mining operations.</p><p>
