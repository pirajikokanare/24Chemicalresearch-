Fine water mist copper powder refers to powder made of various types of bronze or brass alloys, mainly used in paint or glazing medium, or together with copper powder paste (BRONING LIQOID) to form the so-called imitation gold powder pigment. This powder can be used to replicate every shade of gold from light blonde, lemon to dark copper tones, sometimes with some dye added to the paint mix as well. Bronze powder will darken or fade in a short time. Bronze powders are rarely used in fine art because of their lack of permanence, and because the lacquers they make are dull and poorly grained.</p><p>
