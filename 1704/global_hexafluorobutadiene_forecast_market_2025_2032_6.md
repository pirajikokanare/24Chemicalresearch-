</p><p>1,3-Hexafluorobutadiene (C4F6) is a specialized organofluorine compound with the chemical formula (CF2=CF)2. Known for its unique structure comprising two difluorovinyl groups, this compound is a colorless and highly reactive gas. It serves a critical role in the microelectronics industry, primarily as an etchant gas in semiconductor manufacturing processes. The perfluorinated structure of 1,3-Hexafluorobutadiene makes it highly stable under standard conditions while offering superior etching precision during photolithographic steps. It is the perfluoro analogue of butadiene and is often synthesized through the coupling of C2 fluorinated compounds such as chlorotrifluoroethylene or bromotrifluoroethylene. The growth in demand for advanced semiconductor materials, spurred by rapid technological innovation in electronics and communication, underscores the importance of this compound in modern manufacturing.</p><p>
