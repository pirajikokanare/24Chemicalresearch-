</p><p>Agar plates are Petri dishes containing a solidified growth medium with agar, a gelatinous substance extracted from red seaweed, used extensively for culturing microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi in microbiological and clinical laboratories. These plates can be enriched with selective nutrients, dyes, or antibiotics to enable the cultivation and identification of specific microbial strains. As a fundamental tool in microbiology, agar plates facilitate microbial isolation, enumeration, and identification, playing a critical role in research, diagnostics, food safety, and quality control.</p><p>
