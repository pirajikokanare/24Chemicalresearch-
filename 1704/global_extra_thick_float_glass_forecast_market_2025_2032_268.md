</p><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Extra Thick Float Glass is a type of transparent, colorless flat glass manufactured through the float glass process. In this process, molten glass is poured onto a bed of molten metal, typically tin, allowing it to spread evenly, creating a smooth and uniform thickness. Once cooled and hardened, the glass is annealed and cut into desired dimensions. Extra thick float glass is known for its enhanced strength, durability, and optical clarity, making it ideal for applications in construction, automotive, and industrial sectors.</p><p>
