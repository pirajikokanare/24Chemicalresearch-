<h1>Iron Ore Pellets Market, Global Outlook &amp; Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Iron ore pellets are small, spherical agglomerations of iron ore fines combined with binders such as bentonite clay and fired at high temperatures to create a hardened product. These pellets serve as a primary raw material in steel manufacturing, enhancing efficiency in blast furnaces and direct reduction processes. Compared to sinter and lump ore, iron ore pellets offer higher iron content (typically 65-70%), resulting in energy savings and improved steel production performance.</p><p>
